# 📱 Top Instagram Influencers – EDA & Influence Score Prediction

In this project, we explore the world of top Instagram influencers using data science techniques. We analyze influencer metrics, build predictive models, and derive business insights useful for marketing teams looking to collaborate with high-performing individuals.

---

## 🔍 Project Goals

1. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends among top influencers.
2. **Engineer new features** to enhance prediction accuracy.
3. **Build a machine learning model** to predict an influencer's `influence_score`.
4. **Interpret model results** to understand what drives influence.
5. **Deliver business insights** to inform marketing decisions.

## 🧪 Project Pipeline

### 1. 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed follower counts, engagement metrics, categories, and countries.
- Identified top influencers by region and niche.

### 2. ⚙️ Feature Engineering
- Created additional predictive features from raw data (e.g., follower-to-engagement ratios, region flags).

### 3. 🤖 Model Building
- Used regression models to predict the `influence_score`.
- Applied data scaling, train-test splits, and model tuning.

### 4. 📈 Model Evaluation
- Evaluated model performance using **R² score**.
- Analyzed **feature importance** to identify key drivers of influence.
